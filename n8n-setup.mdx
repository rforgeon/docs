# Setting Up Your N8N Instance

AgentRails requires an N8N instance to manage your AI agent workflows. You have three options for setting up N8N:

## Option A: Using N8N Cloud

The simplest option is using N8N's managed cloud service:

1. Visit [N8N Cloud](https://www.n8n.io/cloud/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Create a new workspace
4. Copy your workspace URL

**Pricing:**
- Free tier: Limited to 100 executions/month
- Teams plan: $20/user/month (min. 2 users)
  - Unlimited executions
  - Priority support
  - Team collaboration features
- Enterprise: Custom pricing
  - Custom integrations
  - Dedicated support
  - Advanced security features

## Option B: Quick Start with Docker

Perfect for testing or small deployments:

1. **Pull and Run N8N**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm \
     --name n8n \
     -p 5678:5678 \
     -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
     docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n
   ```
   Your N8N instance will be available at `http://localhost:5678`

**Pricing:**
- Free to run
- Infrastructure costs:
  - Small VPS (~$5-10/month)
  - Docker hosting (~$10-20/month)
  - Domain & SSL (~$1-2/month)

## Option C: Self-Hosting N8N

For production environments, we recommend a proper self-hosted setup:

1. **System Requirements**
   - Node.js 16 or newer
   - Database (PostgreSQL recommended)
   - Redis (optional, for caching)

2. **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install n8n -g
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```env
   N8N_PROTOCOL=https
   N8N_HOST=n8n.your-domain.com
   N8N_PORT=5678
   DB_TYPE=postgresdb
   DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=localhost
   DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
   ```

4. **Production Setup**
   - Set up a reverse proxy (nginx recommended)
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up process manager (PM2 recommended)
   - For detailed instructions, see [N8N's deployment docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/)

**Pricing:**
- Free to run
- Infrastructure costs:
  - Production VPS (~$20-40/month)
  - Managed Database (~$15-30/month)
  - Load Balancer (optional, ~$10/month)
  - Domain & SSL (~$1-2/month)
  - Backup storage (~$5-10/month)

## Connecting to AgentRails

1. In your AgentRails dashboard, go to Settings
2. Enter your N8N instance URL:
   - For self-hosted: Your domain or IP (e.g., `https://n8n.yourdomain.com`)
   - For N8N Cloud: Your workspace URL
3. Save your settings

## Verifying the Connection

1. Go to the Agents page in AgentRails
2. Create a test agent
3. If the connection is successful, you'll see the agent appear in your N8N workflows
